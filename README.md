# XYZ Reader (Material Design Project)

Udacity - Android Developer Nanodegree, Project #5

Given an initial android app with a very poor UI:

The goal is the make the UI useful.  Further to add Material Design features such as depth and animations.

We create a more useful user friendly UI such as: 

![XYZ Reader Midway][image2]
